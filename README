Leavemein is a set of header files that make it easy to embed tests
in C and C++ code and control their execution. The flag LEAVEMEIN is
defined on the compiler command line to enable the tests. When it is
not defined, no tests will be defined or run.

A Complete Example
==================

    /*
     * Test for leavemein
     */

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    #include <leavemein.h>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Should never get to main()");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    #ifdef LEAVEMEIN
    LEAVEMEIN_TEST(simple_good) {
        printf("This is printed by test simple_good\n");
        leavemein_assert_eq(0, 0);
    }

    LEAVEMEIN_TEST(simple_bad) {
        printf("This is printed by test simple_bad\n");
        leavemein_assert_eq(0, 1);
    }

    #endif /* LEAVEMEIN */

To compile, use:

    cc  -Iinclude -DLEAVEMEIN=LEAVEMEIN_LINUX -o simple test/simple.cc

To run, use:

    ./simple

As implied in the example above, when build for LEAVEMEIN, the tests will
halt before main is called. This avoids the possibility of overlooking
that test code is being included.

Platform Support
================
The symbol defined on the compilation command line, LEAVEMEIN, is set
to a value to indicate which version of Leavemein is to be build. There
are presently two possibilities:

    LEAVEMEIN_LINUX             Build for Linux. This allows parallel test
                                execution

    LEAVEMEIN_SINGLE_THREADED   Build for Linux, but as a single-threaded
                                application. Tests are still started with
                                fork() but this could be replaced by a
                                different primative. This is intended to
                                demonstrate how these tests might be
                                set up for an embedded system.

Configuration Variables
=======================
Configuration variables are available to control execution:

LEAVEMEIN_MAX_JOBS  When parallel execution is supported, this limits the
                    number of tests run in parallel.

LEAVEMEIN_RUNLIST   A space-separated list of tests to run.

LEAVEMEIN_TIMEOUT   A floating point value specifying the amount of time
                    a test can be run before being killed. The default is
                    30 seconds. A value of zero means tests will not be
                    halted.

Values for configuration variables may be set in two ways:

1.  If the platform supported takes envirnment variables, variables with
    the above names can be set

2.  If the platform doesn't take environment variables, the values can
    be specified on the compiler command line, e.g. -DLEAVEMEIN_TIMEOUT=2.5
    The single-threaded platform noted above uses this method.
